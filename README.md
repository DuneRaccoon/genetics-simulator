Introduction
------------

Welcome to **EvoSim**, the ultimate evolution simulator where artificial life comes alive! Dive into a dynamic world where virtual creatures with unique DNA roam, interact, and evolve. Witness the marvels of natural selection, genetic drift, and survival of the fittest‚Äîall powered by Python.

Ever wondered how intelligence evolves? How creatures adapt to their environment? With EvoSim, not only can you observe these phenomena, but you can also influence them. Adjust parameters, introduce environmental challenges, and see how your virtual ecosystem responds.

How It Works
------------

### Genetics and Traits

In EvoSim, each creature is defined by a set of chromosomes and genes, much like living organisms. Here's how it mirrors biology:

*   **Chromosomes and Genes**: Creatures have multiple chromosomes, each containing genes that hold values between 0 and 1.
*   **Trait Expression**: Genes influence traits (e.g., strength, speed, intelligence) through weighted mappings, affecting the creature's capabilities.
*   **Phenotype Representation**: Traits are visually represented through the creature's color, providing an immediate visual cue of their genetic makeup.

### Environmental Interactions

The virtual world is rich and varied, offering a range of interactions:

*   **Resources**: Food and water are scattered throughout the grid, and creatures must seek them to survive.
*   **Obstacles**: Randomly placed obstacles create challenges, forcing creatures to navigate intelligently.
*   **Other Creatures**: Depending on their traits, creatures may exhibit aggression, social behaviors, or avoidance.

### Simulation Mechanics

The life of a creature in EvoSim is a complex dance of survival:

*   **Needs and Survival**: Creatures experience hunger, thirst, and energy depletion, driving their behaviors.
*   **Behavioral Decisions**: Actions are determined by needs and traits‚Äîseeking resources, reproducing, or attacking.
*   **Reproduction**: When conditions are right, creatures reproduce, combining genes with crossover and mutation, introducing genetic diversity.
*   **Natural Selection**: Creatures with favorable traits have higher fitness, influencing their survival and reproductive success.
*   **Memory and Intelligence**: Intelligence affects memory capacity and decision-making, leading to behaviors like recalling resource locations or using advanced pathfinding.

### Advanced Pathfinding

Creatures navigate the world using algorithms that reflect their intelligence:

*   **Random Movement**: Low intelligence creatures move randomly.
*   **Greedy Movement**: Slightly smarter creatures move towards immediate goals.
*   **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Medium intelligence creatures use basic pathfinding.
*   **A\* Algorithm**: High intelligence creatures plan efficient paths to their targets.
*   **Bidirectional A\***: The smartest creatures use advanced techniques for optimal navigation.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Interact with the simulation through a user-friendly interface:

*   **Visualization**: The grid displays creatures, resources, and obstacles with intuitive color coding.
*   **Interactive Monitoring**: Click on creatures to view detailed stats, including traits, age, hunger, and thoughts.
*   **Real-Time Updates**: Observe how the ecosystem evolves with each tick of the simulation.
*   **Event Log**: A running log captures significant events, providing insights into the dynamics at play.
